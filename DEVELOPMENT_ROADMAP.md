---

## 🔔 Phase 2: Push Notifications System
**Version: 1.0.4**
**Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - TESTING REQUIRED**

### Goals
Implement a robust native iOS push notification system to keep users engaged with course updates, announcements, and reminders.

### Implementation Tasks

#### Phase 1: Database Cleanup & Token Format ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Deleted all old PWA web push subscriptions
- ✅ Added database documentation for native-only tokens
- ✅ Token format: `native:APNS_TOKEN`

#### Phase 2: Token Registration Flow ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Updated `subscribeToPushNotifications` to prefix tokens with `native:`
- ✅ Edge function handles both `native:TOKEN` and raw token formats

#### Phase 3: Notification Handlers ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Foreground handler**: Shows toast with "View" action button when app is open
- ✅ **Background handler**: Notification appears in notification center, taps navigate to content
- ✅ **Closed handler**: Same as background, launches app and navigates to content
- ✅ **Deep linking**: Supports `url` and `destination_url` in notification data
- ✅ Registered navigation callback with React Router for smooth deep linking
- ✅ Initialized handlers in AppLayout on app launch
- ✅ Badge clearing on app open
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for all notification events

#### Phase 4: User Notification Settings ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Added comprehensive notification settings section in Profile page
- ✅ Shows real-time subscription status (Active/Not Enabled/Denied)
- ✅ Status indicator badge with color coding (green/yellow/red)
- ✅ Enable/disable notifications toggle
- ✅ Re-register button for troubleshooting delivery issues
- ✅ Checks push_subscriptions table for active native tokens
- ✅ Provides guidance for enabling notifications in device settings
- ✅ Shows helpful tips and instructions for each state
- ✅ Quick navigation button in profile quick access menu

#### Phase 4.5: Multi-Touchpoint Notification Reminder System ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive push notification reminder strategy with multiple popups, time-based reminders, and in-app banner

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Created `useNotificationReminder` hook for centralized reminder logic
- ✅ Added localStorage tracking for reminder state and timing
- ✅ **Initial Welcome Popup** in NativeAppLayout (shows 2s after first app launch)
- ✅ **Course Enrollment Reminder** in AppCourseDetail (after user enrolls in first course)
- ✅ **Time-based Persistent Reminders** (every 3 days for first 3 reminders, then weekly)
- ✅ **In-App Banner** on AppHome (dismissible, reappears after 2 days)
- ✅ "Never ask again" option (shows after 2+ prompts)
- ✅ All popups respect user's notification permission status
- ✅ Varied messaging for each reminder type

**localStorage Keys Used:**
- `hasSeenInitialNotificationPrompt`: First popup shown
- `lastNotificationPromptTime`: Last reminder timestamp
- `notificationPromptCount`: Number of reminders shown
- `hasSeenEnrollmentPrompt`: Course enrollment popup shown
- `notificationBannerDismissedTime`: Banner dismissal timestamp
- `userDeclinedNotifications`: User opted out permanently

**Reminder Strategy:**
1. **Initial (first launch):** "Stay Connected!" - 2 seconds after app opens
2. **Enrollment (after first course):** "Never Miss Your Classes!" - 1.5s after enrollment success
3. **Time-based (persistent):** Every 3 days (first 3), then weekly (up to 7 total prompts)
4. **Banner (always visible):** Top of Home screen, dismissible for 2 days
5. **Never Ask Again:** Available after 2+ prompts, permanently disables reminders

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 80%+ of users see at least one notification prompt
- ✅ Reminders are persistent but not annoying (spaced appropriately)
- ✅ Users have clear path to enable notifications at multiple touch points
- ✅ Users can explicitly opt out
- ✅ All reminder logic properly tracked in localStorage

#### Phase 5: Deep Linking & URL Handling ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Notification clicks navigate to correct pages
- ✅ Supports: `/app/home`, `/app/courses`, `/app/course/:slug`, `/app/notifications`

#### Phase 6: Badge Count Management ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Custom badge parameter in edge function
- ✅ Badge clearing on app open (via `initializePushNotificationHandlers`)
- ✅ Badge clearing when notification is tapped (background/closed)
- ✅ Badge clearing when user taps "View" in foreground toast
- ✅ `clearBadge()` function using `removeAllDeliveredNotifications()`
- ✅ `getBadgeCount()` function to retrieve current count
- ✅ Default badge count: 1

#### Phase 7: Admin Panel Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ DeviceManagementPanel filters native iOS devices only
- ✅ PushNotificationSender character limits (title: 50, message: 200)
- ✅ Enhanced preview with bell icon and destination URL
- ✅ Character counters for title and message
